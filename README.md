## Usage/Installation

Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`. Create a `.local` file in the dotfile folder with custom settings being specific for the host machine.

Add the following block to your shell config file such as `.zshrc`, `.profile`, etc.

```
# load custom alias
source $HOME/.dotfiles/.alias

# load custom settings for local env not being commited in the actual dotfles repo
source $HOME/.dotfiles/.local

# load custom functions
source $HOME/.dotfiles/functions.sh
```

Symlink your shell config file from your home directory to the `.dotfiles` folder.

- `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc`
- `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`
